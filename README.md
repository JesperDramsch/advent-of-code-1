# Advent of Code 2020

This repo contains solutions for [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020/) that utilise
tools from the "[open data science stack](https://pydata.org/about/)" such as Python, numpy and
pandas.

This repo uses Jupyter Notebook extensions so it's recommended to load the notebooks in `jupyter
notebook` and not `jupyter lab`.

## Setup

```bash
# Get environment
pip install pip-tools
pip-sync

# Add Jupyter kernel
python -m ipykernel install --user --name advent-of-code --display-name "Python (advent-of-code)"
```
